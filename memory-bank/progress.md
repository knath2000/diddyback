# Progress: Diddyback Backend

## Project Status: **DEPLOY BLOCKED â€“ BUILD PIPELINE TUNING**
**Current Phase**: Stabilisation / Build-fix
**Overall Progress**: Functionality is feature-complete, but the latest Docker build fails due to TypeScript config issues in the new back-fill compilation step. Once resolved, we can redeploy and resume normal sync operations.

## What Works âœ…

### Core Functionality
- âœ… **StockX Price Sync**: A cron job successfully runs every 10 minutes, authenticating with the StockX API and fetching the latest market data for all tracked variants.
- âœ… **Variant-Level Data**: Price data is correctly associated with individual product variants (size/color).
- âœ… **Database Schema**: Prisma schema is up-to-date with all necessary models and relations for StockX data. Migrations have been successfully applied.
- âœ… **API Endpoints**: All item and StockX-related endpoints (`/items`, `/items/:id`, `/items/:id/stockx`, `/items/:id/stockx/history`) are live and serving data correctly.
- âœ… **Authentication**: The StockX OAuth 2.0 refresh token flow is implemented and working.
- âœ… **CORS Policy**: Correctly handles requests from both the browser and the Nuxt SSR environment.

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- âœ… **Fly.io Deployment**: Stable, with CI/CD from the `main` branch.
- âœ… **Secrets Management**: All necessary API keys and credentials (except the refresh token) are securely managed in the Fly.io environment.

## What's Left / Open Issues ðŸš§
1.  **Obtain & Set Refresh Token**: The final `STOCKX_REFRESH_TOKEN` secret needs to be set to enable the backfill script and ongoing sync.
2.  **Fix Build Errors**: Address `esModuleInterop` + duplicate `require` + `import.meta` compile errors to unblock Fly deploy.
3.  **Run Data Backfill**: After a green build, run `db:backfill-stockx-prod` inside the VM to populate historical IDs.
4.  **Monitor Cron Job & Locking**: Validate that the new distributed lock prevents duplicate cron runs across multiple instances.
5.  **Gamification Backend**: Start groundwork after data pipeline is fully stable.

## Major Accomplishments This Session âœ¨
- **Integrated a Major Third-Party API**: Successfully designed, built, and deployed a complete integration with the StockX API, including a complex OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
- **Implemented Background Jobs**: Added a `node-cron` scheduled task for reliable, automated data synchronization.
- **Refactored Database for Granularity**: Migrated the database schema from item-level to variant-level price tracking, a significant architectural improvement.
- **Created a Data Backfill Mechanism**: Built a script to retroactively populate data, ensuring data integrity.
- **Added Distributed Job Lock**: Introduced `JobLock` table & logic to guarantee single-runner cron execution across Fly machines.
- **Environment-Aware Backfill Script**: Refactored to work both in dev and when compiled to JS in the Docker image.
- **Improved Build Process**: Updated `package.json` build pipeline to output compiled back-fill script and added prod helper script.
- **Identified & Scoped Build Failure**: Pin-pointed TypeScript flags causing the current build break; fix queued next session.
- **Resolved Complex CORS Issues**: Debugged and fixed a subtle but critical CORS issue related to Server-Side Rendering, unblocking the entire frontend.
- **Achieved End-to-End Data Flow**: The full lifecycle is now working: the backend syncs data from StockX, stores it, serves it via its API, and the frontend consumes and displays it.
