# Progress: Diddyback Backend

## Project Status: **DEPLOYED BUT NOT SERVING DATA**
**Current Phase**: Deployment Stabilization
**Overall Progress**: Backend is live on Fly.io, but blocked by a database seeding issue.

## What Works ‚úÖ

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Fly.io Deployment**: Application builds and deploys successfully via `flyctl`.
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD**: Pushing to GitHub main branch correctly triggers Fly.io deployments.
- ‚úÖ **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage Dockerfile is optimized for build caching and a small runtime image.
- ‚úÖ **Startup Script**: `docker-entrypoint.sh` reliably runs database migrations before starting the application.
- ‚úÖ **Health Checks**: The app correctly binds to `0.0.0.0` and the `grace_period` is set to `30s`, preventing crash loops.
- ‚úÖ **Autoscaling**: Configured with `min_machines_running = 1` to ensure the app is always online.
- ‚úÖ **Secrets Management**: `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` are correctly set in the Fly.io environment.

### API & Application
- ‚úÖ **CORS**: Correctly configured to allow requests from the local frontend development server.
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints**: The `/api/items` route is implemented and the server starts without errors.

## What's Left to Build üöß

### üö® Immediate Blockers
- ‚è≥ **Database Seeding**: The `pnpm db:seed` command hangs when run on the Fly.io machine. The production database is currently empty.

### Next Steps
1.  **Resolve Seeding Issue**: Diagnose and fix the hanging `db:seed` command.
2.  **Verify Data Flow**: Ensure the `/api/items` endpoint returns seeded data correctly.
3.  **Production URL for CORS**: Add the production frontend URL to the `allowedOrigins` in `src/index.ts`.
4.  **Implement Remaining API Endpoints**: Build out the full API surface as defined in `systemPatterns.md`.
5.  **Add Authentication**: Implement the JWT authentication flow.

## Major Accomplishments This Session ‚ú®
- **Successfully Deployed to Fly.io**: Overcame a series of complex deployment challenges, including:
    - Fixed `pnpm: command not found` errors by correctly installing it in the runtime container.
    - Resolved Prisma `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors by ensuring dependencies were available.
    - Correctly set `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` secrets after discovering they were missing.
    - Installed `openssl` dependency for Prisma.
- **Stabilized the Application**:
    - Eliminated the crash loop by increasing the health check `grace_period`.
    - Prevented the app from scaling to zero by setting `min_machines_running` to 1.
- **Configured CORS**: Enabled communication between the local frontend and the live backend.
- **Established a Robust Deployment Pattern**: Implemented the standard Fly.io practice of running migrations at startup using an entrypoint script.
