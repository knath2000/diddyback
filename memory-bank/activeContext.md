# Active Context: Diddyback Backend

## Current Focus
The primary focus is on populating the database with item data using a robust, local-first HTML parsing workflow. The previous live scraping attempts were thwarted by Cloudflare, so the system has pivoted to a manual, but reliable, data ingestion process.

## Current State
- The database schema has been extended to properly handle item variants, each with its own color and slug. The `Item` model now includes fields for retail price, release date, and a one-to-many relation to a new `ItemImage` table for image galleries.
- A powerful new parser script, `prisma/parse-all-item-details.ts`, has been created. This script reads all `.html` files from the `static/` directory, extracts detailed item information (including color variants), and upserts this data into the NeonDB.
- The system successfully ingested data for 7 items, creating 11 unique variants from the provided HTML source files.
- The `colors` array on the `Item` model has been removed, and the database has been migrated to reflect this cleaner, variant-centric schema.

## Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Continue Data Ingestion**: Use the `parse-all-item-details.ts` script to populate the database with more items as new HTML source files are acquired.
2.  **Frontend Integration**: Ensure the frontend is correctly displaying the newly ingested variant data, including the image galleries and detailed item attributes.
3.  **API Hardening**: Review and test the `/api/items/:id` endpoint to confirm it correctly returns all variant and image data.
