# Active Context: Diddyback Backend

## Current Focus
The backend is now fully integrated with the StockX API for real-time price tracking. The primary focus has shifted from initial data ingestion to maintaining and serving this new price data, while also ensuring robust API performance and reliability for the Nuxt frontend.

## Current State
- **StockX Integration Complete**:
    - The database schema has been updated to support variant-level price tracking, with `stockxProductId` on the `Variant` model and a new `StockXPrice` table for market snapshots.
    - A cron job (`src/jobs/syncStockxMarket.ts`) runs every 10 minutes to fetch and store the latest lowest ask, highest bid, and last sale prices for all tracked variants.
    - An authentication utility (`src/utils/stockxAuth.ts`) handles the StockX OAuth 2.0 refresh token flow.
    - New API endpoints (`/items/:id/stockx` and `/items/:id/stockx/history`) have been created to serve this data to the frontend.
- **Data Backfill Script Created**: A one-time script (`prisma/backfill-stockx-ids.ts`) has been created to populate the `stockxProductId` for existing variants by searching the StockX API.
- **CORS Policy Hardened**: The CORS configuration in `src/index.ts` has been updated to correctly handle origin-less requests from the Nuxt server-side renderer, fixing critical hydration errors on the frontend.
- **Dependencies Updated**: Added `node-cron` for scheduled tasks.

## Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Run Data Backfill**: Execute the `db:backfill-stockx` script once the `STOCKX_REFRESH_TOKEN` is available to populate historical data.
2.  **Monitor Cron Job**: Verify in the Fly.io logs that the `syncStockxMarket` job is running successfully and without errors.
3.  **API Performance**: Monitor the performance of the new StockX-related API endpoints under load.
4.  **Gamification Backend**: Begin planning and building the backend infrastructure for the new gamification features (Hype Points, Achievements).
